# Survey form with React

Made a project using React and concentrating on useState.

Styled with CSS Tailwind. 

Downloaded and configured Tailwind CSS, made most of my styling on classNames in JSX. Made also some tailored editing in CSS when needed.

Made a front page, three questions and a result page. 
Responsive design is set through Tailwind.
